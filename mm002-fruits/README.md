# Matching Mockups #002: Fruit Gallery

## Image Gallery Grid Layout

In this activity, you'll be creating a gallery of fruit images displayed as a grid. You should aim to make your version look as identical as possible to the provided version. Matching the given mockups with absolute 100% accuracy is not expected, however, you should prioritize the objectives listed below.

# Basic Objectives

- Use CSS Grid Layout to arrange the images. Note that some images span multiple rows and/or columns, or overlap another image.
- The design should be responsive:
  - When the width of the page is reduced, the captions should still be properly aligned and readable.
  - On mobile devices, the grid should change to display a single column of images.

# Fonts Used

The following fonts are available via [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/):

- **Libre Baskerville** - used for headers
- **Josefin Sans** - used for the rest of the page content
